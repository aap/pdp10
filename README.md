PDP-10
======

This repository contains some random PDP-10 stuff.
There is some C code for the beginnings of a KL10 microcode emulator,
but more importantly there is verilog for a KA10
that actually works and passes diagnostics on an FPGA.

Verilog KA10
============

The KA10 is passing diagnostics DAKA* on my FPGA.

This repo does not have all necessary files (yet?),
see my repo `pdp6/verilog` for more.
Sorry for the mess.

KL10 Î¼code emulator
===================

I have executed a handful of microinstructions.
Possibly this is a dead end and the whole thing should be approached differently.
